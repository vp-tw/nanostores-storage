## Why nanostores-storage?

While [@nanostores/persistent](https://github.com/nanostores/persistent) provides simple localStorage persistence, **nanostores-storage** is designed for applications that need more:

- **Multiple storage backends** — localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies, memory
- **Fallback chains** — Graceful degradation across storage types
- **Full storage control** — Monitor and manage entire storage contents
- **Built-in testing support** — Memory adapter for unit tests and SSR
